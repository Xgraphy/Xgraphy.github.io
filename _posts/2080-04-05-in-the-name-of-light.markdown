> 2014年12月攝於 斯特拉斯堡, 法國 | Photographed in December 2014 in Strasbourg, France 🇫🇷

<p style='text-align: justify;'>斯特拉斯堡真的是一个特别神奇的城市，坐落在阿尔萨斯-洛林大区，左手法国，右手德国，自古以来就是兵家必争之地，几经易主，最终加入法兰西共和国。它是著名的圣诞之都 (法语：Capitale de Noël)，圣诞期间整个城市都会装饰成为童话般的圣诞世界。2014年，刚刚去法国留学的第一个平安夜，就是在风雪中从卢森堡抵达了斯特拉斯堡。斯特拉斯堡的火车站很有特色，旧的火车站镶嵌在一个现代的玻璃外壳内，颇具时代沧桑感。夜幕降临之后，整个城市便是灯光如昼，街上的彩色霓虹十分绚丽，拿出相机就咔嚓定格了这一画面。</p>
<br>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>从此，「光」便是我生命不可或缺的一部分。夕阳西下的暮光，日出时分的晨光，一路向北的极光，以及同步光源的X光，都是我所热爱的，追逐的，光芒。科学和艺术大概是两座高峰，但当你有幸登上其中一座，你大概会发现，那笼罩在周围的，是哲学的迷雾。我期待在瑞士光源的日夜中用X光揭开微观世界的重重谜题，我也期待拿起手中的相机用可见光记录下大千世界的波澜壮阔。我更期待黑夜过去，地平线上我就是那道「光」。</p>

摄影——以光之名的哲学。

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Strasbourg is really a particularly magical city. It is located in the Alsace-Lorraine region. It is left-handed in France and right-handed in Germany. It has been a battleground for the military since ancient times. After several changes, it eventually joined the French Republic. It is the famous Christmas capital (French: Capitale de Noël), and the whole city will be decorated into a fairytale Christmas world during Christmas. In 2014, the first Christmas Eve that just went to France to study, arrived in Strasbourg from Luxembourg in the snow. The train station in Strasbourg is very special, and the old railway station is set in a modern glass enclosure, which is quite a time of vicissitudes. After the night falls, the whole city is full of lights, and the color neon on the street is very beautiful. When you take out the camera, you will freeze this picture.</p>
<br>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Since then, "light" has been an indispensable part of my life. The dawn of the setting sun, the morning light at sunrise, the aurora all the way to the north, and the X-ray of the synchronous light source are all my favorite, chasing, and shining. Science and art are probably two peaks, but when you are lucky enough to be on one of them, you will probably find that it is the fog of philosophy that surrounds you. I look forward to using X-rays to uncover the mysteries of the microcosm in the day and night of the Swiss light source. I also look forward to picking up the camera in my hand and recording the vastness of the world in the visible light. I am more looking forward to the night, and I am the "light" on the horizon. </p>
