### 挪威的森林 - Norwegian Wood - ノルウェーの森

那里湖面总是澄清 | The lake is always clear  
那里空气充满宁静 | The air is full of tranquillity  
雪白明月照在大地 | Snowwhite moon light is shining the land  
藏著你不愿提起的回忆 | The place holding all the memories not willing to mention  
伍佰《挪威的森林》 | Wubai & China Blue "Norwegian Wood" Lyric

一直有个声音告诉我，去挪威！

飞往奥斯陆的航班上脑海里一直循环着伍佰的挪威的森林，眼前依稀湖面总是澄清，空气充满宁静，雪白明月照在大地。可能每个人都有一片属于自己的森林，迷失的人就迷失了，错过的人再错不过，相逢的人会再相逢。   

人生无离别，谁知恩爱重。—— 苏轼 「宋」

There is always a voice in my mind, GO TO NORWAY!

On the flight to Oslo, there has been the chinese song called "Norwegian Wood" circulating in the mind. The lake is always clear, the air is full of tranquility, and the snowwhite moon light shines on the land. Maybe everyone has a forest of their own, the lost person is lost, the missing person is wrong, and the meeters will meet again.

A life without parting, who knows affectionate heavy. —— Su, Shi 「AD1037-1101, Song Dynasty」
