我有故事，你有酒吗？  
A story I have, for a free beer?

虞美人 · 聽雨    
TUNE: YU MEI REN  "Fair Lady Yu"   
TITLE: LISTENING TO THE RAIN  

蔣捷(南宋)    
-- JIANG JIE (1245 -1301)  
-- Translated by Frank C Yue  

少年聽雨歌樓上，紅燭昏羅帳。    
I listened to the rain in m'youth,  
In romantic song-house uncouth --  
There the silken curtains were lit,  
By dim light red candles transmit.  

壯年聽雨客舟中，江闊雲低，斷雁叫西風。    
Middle aged, I listened again,  
In a traveller's boat, to the rain --  
The sky was low, the river, wide.  
As a lone goose in the west wind cried.  


而今聽雨僧廬下，鬢已星星也。    
Th' sound of falling rain I now trace,  
In a monk's quiet lodging place,   
Where my temple hair's growing gray --   

悲歡離合總無情，一任階前，點滴到天明。     
Grief, joy, parting, union display.   
Their non-sentimental dismay.  
Falling on the steps O let the rain partake,  
Drop by drop slowly, till the day does break.
