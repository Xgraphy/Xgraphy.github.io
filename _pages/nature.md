### 道法自然
### Everything comes naturally.

昔者莊周夢為胡蝶，栩栩然胡蝶也。  
Once upon a time I, Zhuāng Zhōu (= Zhuāngzǐ), dreamt I was a butterfly. 

自喻適志與！不知周也。  
Flapping my wings in true butterfly fashion, I was happy as could be, and I knew nothing of any person named Zhuāng Zhōu.

俄然覺，則蘧蘧然周也。  
But suddenly I awakened, astonished to be Zhuāng Zhōu.

不知周之夢為胡蝶與？  
I still don’t know whether as Zhuāng Zhōu I was dreaming I was a butterfly.

胡蝶之夢為周與？  
 or whether as a butterfly I was dreaming I was Zhuāng Zhōu.

週與胡蝶，則必有分矣。  
There ought to be a difference between Zhuāng Zhōu and a butterfly.

此之謂物化。  
But this is called the transformation of things.
