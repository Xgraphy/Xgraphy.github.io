青玉案 - 元夕  
The Lantern Festival Night - to the tune of Green Jade Table  

辛棄疾(宋)  
by Xin Qiji (1140-1207AD, Song Dynasty, Chinese Poet)  

東風夜放花千樹，更吹落，星如雨。    
Night lights a thousand trees in bloom, a shower of stars blown, by the east wind.  

寶馬雕車香滿路，鳳簫聲動，玉壺光轉，一夜魚龍舞。    
Ornate carriages drawn by gallant horses, filled the boulevards with a sweet fragrance.  
Voice of the magic flute flowing, luster of the jade white urn turning, all night the fishes and the dragons danced.  

蛾兒雪柳黃金縷，笑語盈盈暗香去。    
Butterflies, willows, charms of gold. Gone -- that angelic laughter, that subtle perfume.  

眾裏尋他千百度，驀然回首，那人卻在，燈火闌珊處。  
In the crowds for her I’d searched a thousand times, perchance I turned, and there she was, where lights were few and dim.
